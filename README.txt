In  order to run the application we must :

- run the command npm install to install the modules.

- run the mainpage.js file through the nodejs console in the path carrez/mainpage.js

- go to the link : localhost:8080/myserver


- There is a problem , we have to restart the server (file mainpage) with the console for each url because the file will not be considered after being changed more than once.
